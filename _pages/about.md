Hi, my name is Joshua Atiba, a first-class honors graduate in Mechanical Engineering and the Lead Research Technician at Bells University of Technology, Nigeria. I am passionate about materials engineering, sustainability, and advanced material development, with expertise in corrosion science, advanced coatings, and nanocomposites.

With over fifteen peer-reviewed publications, my work focuses on developing alloys, polymers, and sustainable composites to address global challenges in material science. I have also co-supervised research on fiber-reinforced polymers and nanocomposites derived from biowaste, reflecting my commitment to eco-friendly innovations and knowledge transfer.

I am open to collaborations in materials research, particularly in corrosion science, sustainable composites, and advanced material applications. Letâ€™s work together to drive impactful advancements in this exciting field!
