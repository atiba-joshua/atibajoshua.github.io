**Abstract **
This study focuses on the creation of an original aluminium metal matrix composite by integrating
Palm Kernel Shell (PKS) particles into AA 7075 at various percentages (5wt%, 10wt%, 15wt%, and
20wt%). Stir casting was used to create the composite samples. Mechanical and anticorrosive tests
were carried out to evaluate the produced materials. The study's findings show that the composites'
tensile strength and hardness have increased significantly, while corrosion rates have decreased. The
tensile tests found that the 15% PKS sample had a maximum tensile strength of 89.8983 MPa, up
8.25% from the control sample's 82.4864 MPa. The hardness tests revealed a 23.9% improvement,
with hardness values increasing from 99.48 BHN for the control sample to 123.21 BHN for the 20%
PKS sample. Corrosion rate studies in a 0.5M HCl environment revealed a stunning 61.6% reduction
in corrosion rate, with the 15% PKS sample having the lowest corrosion rate of 1.152 mm/yr
compared to the control sample's 2.300 mm/year. These findings demonstrate that adding agricultural
waste, such as PKS, into aluminium alloys improves mechanical characteristics and corrosion
resistance, hence contributing to the sustainable development of high-performance materials.
