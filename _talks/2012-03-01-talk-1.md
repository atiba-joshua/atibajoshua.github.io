This study focuses on the creation of an original aluminium metal matrix composite by integrating
Palm Kernel Shell (PKS) particles into AA 7075 at various percentages (5wt%, 10wt%, 15wt%, and
20wt%). Stir casting was used to create the composite samples. Mechanical and anticorrosive tests
were carried out to evaluate the produced materials.
