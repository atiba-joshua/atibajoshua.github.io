This project explores the use of agricultural waste materials like rice husk and palm kernel shell as reinforcements for AA7075 aluminium metal matrix composites. By utilizing stir casting, the study achieved enhanced tensile strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance, with a notable reduction in production costs. The findings demonstrate the potential of eco-friendly reinforcements in producing high-performance composites for industrial applications.

Research Collaborators: Asso. Prof. Olufunmilayo Joseph, Ante Simeon.
