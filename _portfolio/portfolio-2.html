This project explores an environmentally friendly approach to synthesizing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from agricultural waste via pyrolysis, addressing waste valorization and sustainable material production. The study investigates polyethylene reinforced with these biowaste-derived CNTs, utilizing melt blending to achieve uniform dispersion and enhanced interfacial adhesion. The findings highlight the feasibility of producing high-performance, sustainable nanocomposites, advancing the field of sustainable materials engineering.
